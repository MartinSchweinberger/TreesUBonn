This repository contains all documents related to the workshop *An introduction to conditional inference trees in R* offered Jan. 19, 2023, by Martin Schweinberger at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Bonn.


This workshop focuses on conditional inference trees and their implementation in R. The workshop uses materials provided by the [*Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory* (LADAL)](www.ladal.edu.au). If you want a more detailed tutorial on tree-based methods going beyond what the workshop covers see [this LADAL tutorial](https://ladal.edu.au/tree.html) or you would like to know more about doing statistics and text analysis with R, please free to visit and explore the [LADAL website](www.ladal.edu.au).


The website for the workshop is available via [this link](https://martinschweinberger.github.io/TreesUBonn/index.html).


A Jupyter notebook that contains the practical exercise is available [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SLCLADAL/interactive-notebooks/main?labpath=notebooks%2Ftreesubonn_bi.ipynb).
