# Introduction {-}

This workshop focuses on conditional inference trees and their implementation in R. The workshop uses materials provided by the [*Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory* (LADAL)](www.ladal.edu.au). If you want a more detailed tutorial on tree-based methods going beyond what the workshop covers see [this LADAL tutorial](https://ladal.edu.au/tree.html) or you would like to know more about doing statistics and text analysis with R, please free to visit and explore the [LADAL website](www.ladal.edu.au).
